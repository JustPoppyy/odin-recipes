    <h3>Lime Jello Salad with Cream Cheese and Marshmallows</h3>
    <p>This Lime Jell-O salad recipe is a holiday favorite at our house. Green jello plus cream cheese, marshmallows, and crushed pineapple combine to make a yummy dessert or side at Thanksgiving or other holiday dinners.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large box (6 oz) lime Jell-O</li>
        <li>1 bag (10 oz) mini marshmallows</li>
        <li>1 block (8 oz) cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 can (20 oz) crushed pineapple</li>
        <li>2 cups boiling water</li>
        <li>Optional: Maraschino cherries</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour green jello into medium mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add marshmallows. Slice the cream cheese into small chunks (quarter-sized or smaller) and add to marshmallows and jello.</li>
        <li>Add one cup of boiling water, stir thoroughly. The marshmallows and cream cheese should begin to melt.</li>
        <li>Add the second cup of boiling water after about one minute of stirring and continue to stir thoroughly. The cream cheese and marshmallows should be mostly melted, but not completely.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed pineappleâ€”do not drain, the juice is part of the recipe. Add maraschino cherries if desired.</li>
        <li>our into 9 by 11 pan and place in fridge to set. It usually needs about two hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This salad can be made with any flavor jello, but it really is best with green jello. For Christmas I will sometimes use raspberry jello, which is my second favorite flavor for this recipe.</p>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
